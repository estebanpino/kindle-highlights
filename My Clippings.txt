Introduction to the First Edition This is a book conceived and created for the independent consultant and boutique consulting firm principal. Having established that, let me point out in the second sentence of the introduction that the strategies, concepts, methodologies, and experiences described herein are equally valid for the partner and practitioner in a larger firm. My seminal work on consulting practices, Million Dollar Consulting, has been read by over half a million people since the first edition was published in 1992. So a logical question is: “How will this book be different?”

The following data points from a 2020 report by Gartner1 on the future of B2B sales further spotlight this conflict in the changing business landscape: • B2B buyers are spending only 17% of their total buyer journey with sales representatives. • A sales representative has roughly 5% of a customer’s total purchase time when you consider that purchase decisions involve many different suppliers. • 44% of millennials prefer not to work with a B2B sales representative. • Millennials are generally twice as skeptical of salespeople as baby boomers. Going one step further, Gartner also reports that “33% of all [B2B] buyers desire a seller-free sales experience”2 and that “70% of the buying process is completed before a buyer interacts with a sales organization.”3

Clearly, we need a better way that enables buyers and sellers to be “on the same page” and working together, not against each other. We need a new system, approach, and playbook that: 1. Creates trust with the buyer and a willingness to talk with our sales teams. 2. Provides the buyer the right information, at the right time, without overwhelming them or creating unnecessary confusion. 3. Enables the buyer to essentially become an extension of our sales team and an ambassador for our company. 4. Results in consistent sales and predictable revenue growth in our business.

At first, I was at a loss. But as I sifted through all the information I had gathered, two common themes emerged: 1. B2B buyers today want to buy products and services the same way that consumers do. 2. Traditional B2B marketing and sale techniques do not align with how B2B buyers now want to buy.

In this book, I will share with you the Revenue Zone System™, which enables you to align your marketing and sales processes with the modern buyer’s journey and turn your prospects and customers into your own high-performing sales team. It’s time to enter “the Revenue Zone” (cue Danger Zone by Kenny Loggins).

What it does mean is that the prospect is at a place where they are seriously considering doing business with your company. For a prospect to enter the Revenue Zone, two things must be in place: 1. The prospect must have a fairly high level of demand for your product or service. 2. The prospect must have a reasonable level of trust in your company. The natural question to ask is, “So then, how can I get a steady stream of prospects into the Revenue Zone quickly and efficiently?” Thankfully, I have an answer.

One of the key takeaways of my research was that B2B prospects and customers want to buy the same way that regular consumers do. As consumers, we are accustomed to doing our own research when considering making a purchase. We have also embraced online purchasing through online retailers like Amazon and other e-commerce sites. We don’t want to engage with a salesperson unless we absolutely need to, and, if it is needed, we expect the salesperson to be more of a guide or consultant than someone who tries to use high-pressure sales techniques.

We want to accomplish these objectives by having control and visibility over our prospects’ and customers’ buying journeys. We want our prospects to engage with our sales teams when we want them to. We want to know when prospects are considering our products and/or services. We want to know who they are. We want to build strong personal relationships with our prospects and customers, so we know what they are thinking and considering.

“salesperson” and toward being a valued guide and consultant enables you to build and maintain strong relationships with your prospects and customers without the need for in-person meetings and interactions. It also enables you to help your prospects gain clarity and “make sense” of their online research. Let the prospect and customer be in control of their own sales process (more on this in a minute) and be ready when they need guidance and support. If you are viewed as a trusted consultant and guide, you will successfully build strong relationships with your prospects and customers virtually. And, when you do meet in person, those meetings will have greater impact and results.

The truth is, buyers want to be in control of everything, not just the research part of making a purchasing decision. And more than anything else, they want to be in control of how and when they are contacted. Prospects aren’t interested in hearing from you directly until they know you can help them and they are ready to receive your help. This can prove to be a challenge, especially when we want to control the marketing and sales process every step of the way. Think of yourself when you are considering buying something. Do you want to be bombarded by phone calls, emails, and text messages while you are doing your initial research? Do you want to enter your email and/or phone number in an opt-in form just to get information that you need as part of your research? No, you don’t. This brings us to Revenue Zone rule #2.

They want to control the journey and talk with someone only when they are ready and only when that conversation is going to be consultative and valuable. Essentially, they want to be their own salesperson.

B2B DIFFERENCES Noelle’s car purchase was a very important and significant buying decision for her. However, in Noelle’s case, she did all the research and made the buying decision on her own. In the B2B arena, most buying decisions are not made by a single person. More likely, there is a team or a larger group of stakeholders driving the buying process. B2B teams also want to buy like they do as consumers. They want to do their own research, they only want to talk with salespeople when they are ready, they want guidance and consultation rather than being pressured, and they want to be in control of the buying process.

As prospects move through the funnel, many become disqualified (or they disqualify themselves), until the few remaining prospects at the end of the funnel ultimately become customers. Of course, the goal of a good funnel is to keep as many prospects in the funnel for as long as possible by controlling the buyer journey as tightly as possible. However, as we discussed in the last chapter, this is the exact opposite of how prospects want to operate in today’s world. Today, prospects want to control their own buyer’s journey. Traditional funnels are designed to give prospects as little control as possible.

This is why marketing and salespeople everywhere need to pivot and adopt a more modern approach: the traditional funnel is no longer a workable model because it’s all about controlling the buyer’s journey. We must instead be willing to provide guidance to prospects and help facilitate their buyer’s journey rather than trying to control it.

The Revenue Zone is a place in the buyer’s journey where a prospect is seriously considering spending money with your company for your products or services.

This does not mean there is no other competition, and it does not mean the prospect is not seriously considering buying from others. It does not even mean they are “ready” to close and make the purchase. What it does mean is that they are at a place where they are seriously considering doing business with your company.

For a prospect to enter the Revenue Zone, two things must be true: 1. The prospect has a fairly high level of demand (a pressing need and excitement) for your product or service, and 2. The prospect has a reasonable level of trust and confidence in your company.

On the vertical axis, we measure whether the prospect has awareness of, interest in, or demand for your product or service. On the horizontal axis, we measure the quality and relevance of the relationship that exists between the prospect and your company by marking whether they know you, like you, or trust you.

Awareness: The entry-point on the vertical axis of the RZ Matrix is awareness, which simply means that the prospect has some level of awareness of your product or service. They could have only a tiny amount of awareness, but a prospect can only be on the RZ Matrix if they have at least some level of awareness of what you do. No business will buy from you if they have no idea what you sell, so it doesn’t make sense to call them a prospect until they do. Interest: The next level up is interest. This means that not only is the prospect aware of your existence, but they also have some level of interest in how your products or services can help them solve a problem, address a pain point, or provide other value in their business. In this stage, prospects are likely conducting research and working to better understand your products or services. Demand: Have you ever wanted something really badly? Maybe a new car, a new bicycle, or a new computer? If so, you can probably recall experiencing an emotional feeling—combined with logical reasoning—pushing you toward that thing that you really wanted. This state is what I refer to as demand, and as far as prospects’ ascension up this vertical axis goes, our ultimate goal is to get them to this state. When prospects demand what you offer, prospects have a real need for what you offer and a clear understanding of how your products or services will benefit their business.

Know: Just like awareness on the vertical axis, this first stage is where your prospect enters your RZ matrix on the horizontal axis. Know means that the prospect has some knowledge that you or your company exist (this is different from being aware that your product or service exists).

Like: The next stage on the trust scale is like. What this means is that the prospect is experiencing some level of affinity for you, your team, or your company. It is important to note that this affinity does not have to come about from personal conversations or one-on-one interactions. Rather, this affinity will more likely come about based on what the prospect learns about you and your company as they do their research and their overall experience with your company. You can also win points in your prospects’ eyes by making their research easy for them.

Trust: As you continue to add more and more value (in a friendly and professional manner), the prospect will ultimately begin to trust you and your company. They will become convinced that you can truly help them solve their problem or achieve their target outcome now and in the future. This trust level is based on the authenticity, knowledge, and value they receive from you and your company. They want to know you’re honest, that you have the experience to help them, and that you can get them real results based on the value you and your company bring

In summary, in order to get your prospects to ascend into the Revenue Zone, you must do two things: 1. Move prospects up the vertical axis in terms of their awareness, interest, and demand for your products or services. 2. Move prospects to the right on the horizontal axis by helping them know, like, and trust your business, your brand, and your team.

The question is now this: How do you get a prospect from the bottom left corner of the RZ Matrix into the Revenue Zone? And, more importantly, how do you do this repeatedly, predictably, and consistently?

In Chapter 2 we discussed how prospects want to be in control of the buying process and how they will, in most cases, work to remain anonymous as long as possible as they do their own research. But why do they want to remain anonymous? You guessed it! They do not want to be nagged or pressured by a salesperson, especially when they’re really just trying to learn more about your product(s) or service(s) and your company.

The fact is that we, as sales and marketing professionals, have driven our prospects undercover through aggressive sales follow-ups, spam emails, and other intrusive marketing actions. Because of this, prospects have developed consistent behavior for each point of the matrix to ward off old-school, high-pressure sales tactics.

So, like it or not, we have to accept and adapt to the fact that most prospects are going to start out (and potentially spend a fair amount of time) in what I call “the Anonymous Zone” when they first enter the RZ Matrix.

While researching you, the prospect is also probably taking the same steps to check out your competitors. The main reason that prospects try to stay in the Anonymous Zone is that they do not want to be interrupted, disrupted, or pressured into making a decision.

The remaining zone in the RZ Matrix is the Engagement Zone—the area that lies between the Anonymous Zone and the Revenue Zone. The Engagement Zone represents the point where prospects are willing to identify themselves and possibly even have a conversation with someone in your business.

Another common misconception is that prospects enter the Engagement Zone when they “opt-in” on your website or landing page in order to access gated content. Unfortunately, this is rarely the case.

FROM THE REVENUE ZONE TO REVENUE Before we continue, I want to spotlight a couple more points related to the Revenue Zone. Just because a prospect is in the Revenue Zone doesn’t mean they are ready to buy or make a purchase. While prospects are “seriously considering spending money with your business,” when in the Revenue Zone, there is still work to be done to transition those prospects into paying customers.

- La subrayado en la posición 539-542 | Añadido el jueves, 28 de septiembre de 2023 00:48:06

There are two more qualification points that prospects in the Revenue Zone need to hit for them to be ready to purchase. You can assess their readiness with two questions: 1. Do they have the available budget to make the purchase? 2. Do they have an “impending event”?
==========

The fastest and easiest way to transition a prospect in the Revenue Zone into a paying customer is to make sure the prospect has the necessary budget and a clearly defined impending event.
==========
﻿The Revenue Zone The Ultimate Playbook for The... (Z-Library) (Burton, Tom)
- La subrayado en la posición 545-551 | Añadido el jueves, 28 de septiembre de 2023 00:50:26

By “impending event,” I mean that there is some future event that is literally going to force a decision to be made and cause the prospect to commit and purchase. This could be an internal deadline, an external mandate, an upcoming board meeting, a budget that needs to be utilized before the end of a fiscal year, or anything else. It does not matter what it is, but it is important to know that, in B2B sales, impending events are what drive decisions (and purchases). Many sales teams try to create impending events with end-of-month or end-of-quarter discounts and other incentives. Sometimes these offers are sufficiently motivating to function as valid impending events. But if you understand and appreciate your prospect’s true impending event, you will have a far better chance of converting them into a paying customer. You’ll also do so with fewer discounts and less stress.

However, this work will pay big dividends, and you will have a huge competitive advantage over your competitors who do not have their YBR defined and implemented.

The job of the YBR is to keep prospects who have entered your RZ Matrix moving forward in their journey along both axes, while at the same time removing doubts, objections, and barriers along the way in a manner that facilitates and guides (but does not force) their journey to becoming a paying customer. As we know, the prospect wants to be in control of their research and buying process. They want to make their own decisions, and they generally don’t want to talk with salespeople. Instead, they want to remain in the Anonymous Zone as long as they possibly can.

Chapter Summary • In order to navigate and weather the perfect disruptive storm, you need specific guidelines and rules to follow. • The Revenue Zone has three rules that will guide you to success. • Rule #1 - Become a valued consultant and guide for your prospects and customers. • Rule #2 – Make it easy for your prospect to remain anonymous as long as they desire while doing their research and due diligence. • Rule #3 – Help your prospects and customers control their buyer’s journey by making it easy for them to get the information they need at the right time and in the right place. • In addition to the three rules, it is important to shift from the old-school sales and marketing mindset to the Revenue Zone mindset. • Noelle’s car buying experience spotlights the difference between an old-school mindset and the Revenue Zone mindset. • Noelle’s experience can be applied to a B2B buyer journey that is driven by a team versus an individual. Recognize and accommodate the fact that teams still want to maintain control of their buying decisions. • Instead of asking what you are trying to accomplish as a seller, ask what your prospect needs to become a buyer and accommodate their needs. Be the buyer! • Recognize that when you facilitate a good buyer-controlled journey, you can turn your prospects into high-performing ambassadors for your company to their friends, family, and colleagues.

Chapter Summary • Traditional sales and marketing funnels have become obsolete as prospects want buyer-controlled journeys that allow them to be in control of their sales process. • The RZ Matrix is a new and modern alternative to traditional funnels. • The RZ Matrix is composed of two axes, each of which has three stages. • The vertical axis ascends from awareness to interest to demand. • The horizontal axis progresses from know to like to trust. • Inside the RZ matrix, there are three areas: the Anonymous Zone, the Engagement Zone, and the Revenue Zone. • Prospects will pass through two zones on the road to the Revenue Zone: the Anonymous Zone and (potentially) the Engagement Zone. • Prospects are not necessarily more informed than ever, but they do have an overwhelming amount of information and data available to them. • Once a prospect reaches the Revenue Zone, they must have two things to become a customer: a budget and an impending event. • The Revenue Zone for your specific product or service is formed when you identify three understandings and three beliefs that your prospect must have to seriously consider buying from your business. • The genesis of the RZ Matrix goes back long before my transformational sales presentation but has evolved rapidly as a result of that event.

Chapter Summary • I discovered (the hard way) that traditional sales and marketing actions and forecasting were outdated and ineffective. • I embarked on an in-depth research quest to understand what was occurring and why. According to my findings, business buyers want to behave more like consumers when buying and traditional B2B sales and marketing tactics do not align with this desire. • The Revenue Zone introduces a unique system and approach for generating consistent sales and achieving predictable revenue growth with today’s B2B prospects and customers. • The disruptors driving this new world were taking hold prior to the pandemic but were amplified and accelerated by COVID-19. • Virtual business is here to stay. • Privacy is a huge concern for both individuals and businesses and will continue to be scrutinized by lawmakers and legislators. • B2B buyers want to be in control of their buyer’s journey and expect a “digital first” experience. • Millennials will make up most of B2B buyers by as early as 2025. • The Revenue Zone System will help you build a Yellow Brick Road that leads prospects into the Revenue Zone as efficiently as possible. • The Revenue Zone System will help you make consistent sales and achieve predictable revenue growth into this next decade.

You may be excited to assemble your internal YBR “construction team” and begin laying the bricks that will ultimately get your prospect into the Revenue Zone. But before you dive in, I have a few suggestions and words of caution:
==========

- La subrayado en la posición 886-889 | Añadido el viernes, 29 de septiembre de 2023 19:36:32

Try to avoid overanalyzing and taking too much time with your brick selections. At this point, you are simply constructing an initial version of your YBR, and it may be a little rough and even contain a few potholes. That is fine—over time you will constantly be working to make your YBR smoother and better. For now, the most important thing is to get your initial YBR created versus focusing on making it perfect.

Don’t get bogged down by cracked or missing bricks. As I mentioned in the last chapter, you will likely find that you are missing critical bricks or that some of your bricks are “cracked” (meaning that they could be out of date, incomplete, or require changes and updates to be made to them).

Narrow your selection to the five best bricks you currently have available and note that changes to these bricks may be needed in the future or that new bricks may be required. 2.

You likely also discovered a few missing or cracked bricks that you would like to take care of. What’s more, you will likely find as time goes on that your prospects’ buying behaviors change over time and that even a perfect YBR can become outdated and require major updates.

As a result, you will need a plan for the ongoing project of optimizing your YBR. Optimizations will generally fall into three categories: • Creating new bricks (across all categories) that will help accelerate and enhance the Buyer’s Journey and prospects’ experience through the four milestones and into the Revenue Zone. • Updating or enhancing existing bricks that are currently part of your YBR. • Updating the sequence and roadmap you prefer prospects to follow along your YBR.

Doing so makes your YBR much more difficult to test and validate as your data for each version of the process becomes limited. And when you do make changes, don’t make too many all at one time, or you won’t be able to know which changes were effective and which were not.

Do not expect immediate or overnight success with tons of new prospects flying into the Revenue Zone as soon as you launch your YBR. What we are looking to achieve is a consistently growing number of prospects reaching the Revenue Zone and, over time, the ability to predict how many prospects will end up there. There are a number of tools and techniques that I will cover in future chapters to help track and monitor this progress. For now, as you launch and monitor your YBR, stay focused on the sequence and whether prospects are reaching your defined milestones. In addition to those common issues, here are a few frequently asked questions my team and I often receive.

In the fifth week, the fine was enacted. It was announced that any parent arriving more than ten minutes late would pay $3 per child for each incident. The fee would be added to the parents’ monthly bill, which was roughly $380. After the fine was enacted, the number of late pickups promptly went…up. Before long there were twenty late pickups per week, more than double the original average. The incentive had plainly backfired. Economics is, at root, the study of incentives: how people get what they want, or need, especially when other people want or need the same thing. Economists love incentives. They love to dream them up and enact them, study them and tinker with them. The typical economist believes the world has not yet invented a problem that he cannot fix if given a free hand to design the proper incentive scheme. His solution may not always be pretty—it may involve coercion or exorbitant penalties or the violation of civil liberties—but the original problem, rest assured, will be fixed. An incentive is a bullet, a lever, a key: an often tiny object with astonishing power to change a situation.

The RE Flywheel is based on “the Flywheel effect” first introduced by Jim Collins and his book Good to Great.

For our purposes, a Flywheel is essentially a self-reinforcing loop driven by a few key initiatives and actions that build on each other and result in immense revenue momentum. This is different from a funnel, where you start at the top and you work your way down. It’s also different from the Revenue Zone Matrix, in which you start at the bottom and work your way up.

1. Give your new customer a remarkable post-sale experience immediately after the sales process is complete (or even before). 2. Leverage the post-sale experience to organically create additional demand for (and sales of) your products and services. 3. Enable your customer to become an ambassador for your products, services, and company. 4. Rinse and repeat.

- La subrayado en la posición 1061-1063 | Añadido el sábado, 30 de septiembre de 2023 12:13:58

• Velocity: The first part of the V3 Experience is velocity. What this means is that you need to provide whatever the customer bought (or if they purchased a service, begin providing) as quickly as possible.

- La subrayado en la posición 1069-1071 | Añadido el sábado, 30 de septiembre de 2023 12:16:20

• Validation: The final component of the V3 Experience is validation. Once your customer has started to receive some level of value, you want to look at how that value can be spotlighted within their organization so the person or team who made the buying decision is validated for making a good choice.

An important part of the Revenue Expansion Flywheel (as well as the Revenue Zone Matrix) is understanding the adage, “People love to buy but hate to be sold.” In the B2B world, the V3 Experience opens the door for additional sales and revenue expansion without additional “selling.” The key to this step working smoothly is having a clear revenue expansion plan and, based on that plan, helping the customer receive more and more value with each additional purchase.

Your Resource Center acts as your content hub for all the bricks on your YBR. Its purpose is to make it easy for your prospects to find all the relevant information they need without having to leave your site and bounce around the web. Your Marketing Automation system helps track prospect engagement with emails and web pages while at the same time automating “smart” follow-up actions based on prospects’ behavior. The top layer of your RZ Tech Stack is all about the “what,” “why,” and “who.” Your Analytics tool (such as Google Analytics) helps you understand what is taking place on your website, RZ Matrix, and RE Flywheel. Your Behavior Tracking tool enables you to understand why these actions and behaviors are taking place so that you can better optimize your YBR and your YBR bricks. Finally, your Visitor Identification tool helps you understand who is in the Anonymous Zone of your RZ Matrix at the company level, so you can be sure that you are bringing the right companies into your RZ Matrix.

As you may recall, in Chapter 1 we discussed the impact that the Privacy Paradigm has made on our ability to make consistent sales and drive predictable revenue growth. The good news is that there is a very valuable “side effect” that you will receive from your Revenue Zone Tech Stack that mitigates this limitation: the ongoing accumulation of first-party data.

There are a few more nuances to first- and third-party data, but these are the fundamental differences. With the changes and restrictions associated with the Privacy Paradigm, access to third-party data has become increasingly difficult and costly to obtain. However, the good news is that your RZ Tech Stack can provide you with a steady stream of first-party data.
