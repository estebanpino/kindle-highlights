Introduction to the First Edition This is a book conceived and created for the independent consultant and boutique consulting firm principal. Having established that, let me point out in the second sentence of the introduction that the strategies, concepts, methodologies, and experiences described herein are equally valid for the partner and practitioner in a larger firm. My seminal work on consulting practices, Million Dollar Consulting, has been read by over half a million people since the first edition was published in 1992. So a logical question is: “How will this book be different?”

The following data points from a 2020 report by Gartner1 on the future of B2B sales further spotlight this conflict in the changing business landscape: • B2B buyers are spending only 17% of their total buyer journey with sales representatives. • A sales representative has roughly 5% of a customer’s total purchase time when you consider that purchase decisions involve many different suppliers. • 44% of millennials prefer not to work with a B2B sales representative. • Millennials are generally twice as skeptical of salespeople as baby boomers. Going one step further, Gartner also reports that “33% of all [B2B] buyers desire a seller-free sales experience”2 and that “70% of the buying process is completed before a buyer interacts with a sales organization.”3

Clearly, we need a better way that enables buyers and sellers to be “on the same page” and working together, not against each other. We need a new system, approach, and playbook that: 1. Creates trust with the buyer and a willingness to talk with our sales teams. 2. Provides the buyer the right information, at the right time, without overwhelming them or creating unnecessary confusion. 3. Enables the buyer to essentially become an extension of our sales team and an ambassador for our company. 4. Results in consistent sales and predictable revenue growth in our business.

At first, I was at a loss. But as I sifted through all the information I had gathered, two common themes emerged: 1. B2B buyers today want to buy products and services the same way that consumers do. 2. Traditional B2B marketing and sale techniques do not align with how B2B buyers now want to buy.

In this book, I will share with you the Revenue Zone System™, which enables you to align your marketing and sales processes with the modern buyer’s journey and turn your prospects and customers into your own high-performing sales team. It’s time to enter “the Revenue Zone” (cue Danger Zone by Kenny Loggins).

What it does mean is that the prospect is at a place where they are seriously considering doing business with your company. For a prospect to enter the Revenue Zone, two things must be in place: 1. The prospect must have a fairly high level of demand for your product or service. 2. The prospect must have a reasonable level of trust in your company. The natural question to ask is, “So then, how can I get a steady stream of prospects into the Revenue Zone quickly and efficiently?” Thankfully, I have an answer.

One of the key takeaways of my research was that B2B prospects and customers want to buy the same way that regular consumers do. As consumers, we are accustomed to doing our own research when considering making a purchase. We have also embraced online purchasing through online retailers like Amazon and other e-commerce sites. We don’t want to engage with a salesperson unless we absolutely need to, and, if it is needed, we expect the salesperson to be more of a guide or consultant than someone who tries to use high-pressure sales techniques.

We want to accomplish these objectives by having control and visibility over our prospects’ and customers’ buying journeys. We want our prospects to engage with our sales teams when we want them to. We want to know when prospects are considering our products and/or services. We want to know who they are. We want to build strong personal relationships with our prospects and customers, so we know what they are thinking and considering.

“salesperson” and toward being a valued guide and consultant enables you to build and maintain strong relationships with your prospects and customers without the need for in-person meetings and interactions. It also enables you to help your prospects gain clarity and “make sense” of their online research. Let the prospect and customer be in control of their own sales process (more on this in a minute) and be ready when they need guidance and support. If you are viewed as a trusted consultant and guide, you will successfully build strong relationships with your prospects and customers virtually. And, when you do meet in person, those meetings will have greater impact and results.

The truth is, buyers want to be in control of everything, not just the research part of making a purchasing decision. And more than anything else, they want to be in control of how and when they are contacted. Prospects aren’t interested in hearing from you directly until they know you can help them and they are ready to receive your help. This can prove to be a challenge, especially when we want to control the marketing and sales process every step of the way. Think of yourself when you are considering buying something. Do you want to be bombarded by phone calls, emails, and text messages while you are doing your initial research? Do you want to enter your email and/or phone number in an opt-in form just to get information that you need as part of your research? No, you don’t. This brings us to Revenue Zone rule #2.

They want to control the journey and talk with someone only when they are ready and only when that conversation is going to be consultative and valuable. Essentially, they want to be their own salesperson.

B2B DIFFERENCES Noelle’s car purchase was a very important and significant buying decision for her. However, in Noelle’s case, she did all the research and made the buying decision on her own. In the B2B arena, most buying decisions are not made by a single person. More likely, there is a team or a larger group of stakeholders driving the buying process. B2B teams also want to buy like they do as consumers. They want to do their own research, they only want to talk with salespeople when they are ready, they want guidance and consultation rather than being pressured, and they want to be in control of the buying process.

As prospects move through the funnel, many become disqualified (or they disqualify themselves), until the few remaining prospects at the end of the funnel ultimately become customers. Of course, the goal of a good funnel is to keep as many prospects in the funnel for as long as possible by controlling the buyer journey as tightly as possible. However, as we discussed in the last chapter, this is the exact opposite of how prospects want to operate in today’s world. Today, prospects want to control their own buyer’s journey. Traditional funnels are designed to give prospects as little control as possible.

This is why marketing and salespeople everywhere need to pivot and adopt a more modern approach: the traditional funnel is no longer a workable model because it’s all about controlling the buyer’s journey. We must instead be willing to provide guidance to prospects and help facilitate their buyer’s journey rather than trying to control it.

The Revenue Zone is a place in the buyer’s journey where a prospect is seriously considering spending money with your company for your products or services.

This does not mean there is no other competition, and it does not mean the prospect is not seriously considering buying from others. It does not even mean they are “ready” to close and make the purchase. What it does mean is that they are at a place where they are seriously considering doing business with your company.

For a prospect to enter the Revenue Zone, two things must be true: 1. The prospect has a fairly high level of demand (a pressing need and excitement) for your product or service, and 2. The prospect has a reasonable level of trust and confidence in your company.

On the vertical axis, we measure whether the prospect has awareness of, interest in, or demand for your product or service. On the horizontal axis, we measure the quality and relevance of the relationship that exists between the prospect and your company by marking whether they know you, like you, or trust you.

THE DEMAND AXIS (VERTICAL)

Awareness: The entry-point on the vertical axis of the RZ Matrix is awareness, which simply means that the prospect has some level of awareness of your product or service. They could have only a tiny amount of awareness, but a prospect can only be on the RZ Matrix if they have at least some level of awareness of what you do. No business will buy from you if they have no idea what you sell, so it doesn’t make sense to call them a prospect until they do. Interest: The next level up is interest. This means that not only is the prospect aware of your existence, but they also have some level of interest in how your products or services can help them solve a problem, address a pain point, or provide other value in their business. In this stage, prospects are likely conducting research and working to better understand your products or services. Demand: Have you ever wanted something really badly? Maybe a new car, a new bicycle, or a new computer? If so, you can probably recall experiencing an emotional feeling—combined with logical reasoning—pushing you toward that thing that you really wanted. This state is what I refer to as demand, and as far as prospects’ ascension up this vertical axis goes, our ultimate goal is to get them to this state. When prospects demand what you offer, prospects have a real need for what you offer and a clear understanding of how your products or services will benefit their business.

Know: Just like awareness on the vertical axis, this first stage is where your prospect enters your RZ matrix on the horizontal axis. Know means that the prospect has some knowledge that you or your company exist (this is different from being aware that your product or service exists).

Like: The next stage on the trust scale is like. What this means is that the prospect is experiencing some level of affinity for you, your team, or your company. It is important to note that this affinity does not have to come about from personal conversations or one-on-one interactions. Rather, this affinity will more likely come about based on what the prospect learns about you and your company as they do their research and their overall experience with your company. You can also win points in your prospects’ eyes by making their research easy for them.

Trust: As you continue to add more and more value (in a friendly and professional manner), the prospect will ultimately begin to trust you and your company. They will become convinced that you can truly help them solve their problem or achieve their target outcome now and in the future. This trust level is based on the authenticity, knowledge, and value they receive from you and your company. They want to know you’re honest, that you have the experience to help them, and that you can get them real results based on the value you and your company bring

In summary, in order to get your prospects to ascend into the Revenue Zone, you must do two things: 1. Move prospects up the vertical axis in terms of their awareness, interest, and demand for your products or services. 2. Move prospects to the right on the horizontal axis by helping them know, like, and trust your business, your brand, and your team.

The question is now this: How do you get a prospect from the bottom left corner of the RZ Matrix into the Revenue Zone? And, more importantly, how do you do this repeatedly, predictably, and consistently?

In Chapter 2 we discussed how prospects want to be in control of the buying process and how they will, in most cases, work to remain anonymous as long as possible as they do their own research. But why do they want to remain anonymous? You guessed it! They do not want to be nagged or pressured by a salesperson, especially when they’re really just trying to learn more about your product(s) or service(s) and your company.

The fact is that we, as sales and marketing professionals, have driven our prospects undercover through aggressive sales follow-ups, spam emails, and other intrusive marketing actions. Because of this, prospects have developed consistent behavior for each point of the matrix to ward off old-school, high-pressure sales tactics.

So, like it or not, we have to accept and adapt to the fact that most prospects are going to start out (and potentially spend a fair amount of time) in what I call “the Anonymous Zone” when they first enter the RZ Matrix.

While researching you, the prospect is also probably taking the same steps to check out your competitors. The main reason that prospects try to stay in the Anonymous Zone is that they do not want to be interrupted, disrupted, or pressured into making a decision.

Yes, prospects certainly have more data and information than ever. But this abundance of data frequently results in information overload. It’s also easy for prospects to get confused as they try to sort through conflicting opinions, ratings, and advice.

The remaining zone in the RZ Matrix is the Engagement Zone—the area that lies between the Anonymous Zone and the Revenue Zone. The Engagement Zone represents the point where prospects are willing to identify themselves and possibly even have a conversation with someone in your business.

Another common misconception is that prospects enter the Engagement Zone when they “opt-in” on your website or landing page in order to access gated content. Unfortunately, this is rarely the case.

FROM THE REVENUE ZONE TO REVENUE Before we continue, I want to spotlight a couple more points related to the Revenue Zone. Just because a prospect is in the Revenue Zone doesn’t mean they are ready to buy or make a purchase. While prospects are “seriously considering spending money with your business,” when in the Revenue Zone, there is still work to be done to transition those prospects into paying customers.
==========

There are two more qualification points that prospects in the Revenue Zone need to hit for them to be ready to purchase. You can assess their readiness with two questions: 1. Do they have the available budget to make the purchase? 2. Do they have an “impending event”?
==========

The fastest and easiest way to transition a prospect in the Revenue Zone into a paying customer is to make sure the prospect has the necessary budget and a clearly defined impending event.
==========
﻿The Revenue Zone The Ultimate Playbook for The... (Z-Library) (Burton, Tom)
- La subrayado en la posición 545-551 | Añadido el jueves, 28 de septiembre de 2023 00:50:26

By “impending event,” I mean that there is some future event that is literally going to force a decision to be made and cause the prospect to commit and purchase. This could be an internal deadline, an external mandate, an upcoming board meeting, a budget that needs to be utilized before the end of a fiscal year, or anything else. It does not matter what it is, but it is important to know that, in B2B sales, impending events are what drive decisions (and purchases). Many sales teams try to create impending events with end-of-month or end-of-quarter discounts and other incentives. Sometimes these offers are sufficiently motivating to function as valid impending events. But if you understand and appreciate your prospect’s true impending event, you will have a far better chance of converting them into a paying customer. You’ll also do so with fewer discounts and less stress.
