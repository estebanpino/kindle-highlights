Introduction to the First Edition This is a book conceived and created for the independent consultant and boutique consulting firm principal. Having established that, let me point out in the second sentence of the introduction that the strategies, concepts, methodologies, and experiences described herein are equally valid for the partner and practitioner in a larger firm. My seminal work on consulting practices, Million Dollar Consulting, has been read by over half a million people since the first edition was published in 1992. So a logical question is: “How will this book be different?”

The following data points from a 2020 report by Gartner1 on the future of B2B sales further spotlight this conflict in the changing business landscape: • B2B buyers are spending only 17% of their total buyer journey with sales representatives. • A sales representative has roughly 5% of a customer’s total purchase time when you consider that purchase decisions involve many different suppliers. • 44% of millennials prefer not to work with a B2B sales representative. • Millennials are generally twice as skeptical of salespeople as baby boomers. Going one step further, Gartner also reports that “33% of all [B2B] buyers desire a seller-free sales experience”2 and that “70% of the buying process is completed before a buyer interacts with a sales organization.”3

Clearly, we need a better way that enables buyers and sellers to be “on the same page” and working together, not against each other. We need a new system, approach, and playbook that: 1. Creates trust with the buyer and a willingness to talk with our sales teams. 2. Provides the buyer the right information, at the right time, without overwhelming them or creating unnecessary confusion. 3. Enables the buyer to essentially become an extension of our sales team and an ambassador for our company. 4. Results in consistent sales and predictable revenue growth in our business.

At first, I was at a loss. But as I sifted through all the information I had gathered, two common themes emerged: 1. B2B buyers today want to buy products and services the same way that consumers do. 2. Traditional B2B marketing and sale techniques do not align with how B2B buyers now want to buy.

In this book, I will share with you the Revenue Zone System™, which enables you to align your marketing and sales processes with the modern buyer’s journey and turn your prospects and customers into your own high-performing sales team. It’s time to enter “the Revenue Zone” (cue Danger Zone by Kenny Loggins).

What it does mean is that the prospect is at a place where they are seriously considering doing business with your company. For a prospect to enter the Revenue Zone, two things must be in place: 1. The prospect must have a fairly high level of demand for your product or service. 2. The prospect must have a reasonable level of trust in your company. The natural question to ask is, “So then, how can I get a steady stream of prospects into the Revenue Zone quickly and efficiently?” Thankfully, I have an answer.

One of the key takeaways of my research was that B2B prospects and customers want to buy the same way that regular consumers do. As consumers, we are accustomed to doing our own research when considering making a purchase. We have also embraced online purchasing through online retailers like Amazon and other e-commerce sites. We don’t want to engage with a salesperson unless we absolutely need to, and, if it is needed, we expect the salesperson to be more of a guide or consultant than someone who tries to use high-pressure sales techniques.

We want to accomplish these objectives by having control and visibility over our prospects’ and customers’ buying journeys. We want our prospects to engage with our sales teams when we want them to. We want to know when prospects are considering our products and/or services. We want to know who they are. We want to build strong personal relationships with our prospects and customers, so we know what they are thinking and considering.

“salesperson” and toward being a valued guide and consultant enables you to build and maintain strong relationships with your prospects and customers without the need for in-person meetings and interactions. It also enables you to help your prospects gain clarity and “make sense” of their online research. Let the prospect and customer be in control of their own sales process (more on this in a minute) and be ready when they need guidance and support. If you are viewed as a trusted consultant and guide, you will successfully build strong relationships with your prospects and customers virtually. And, when you do meet in person, those meetings will have greater impact and results.

In addition to privacy concerns, the fact is that your prospects want to conduct as much research on your company, products, and services as they can on their own, and they want to remain anonymous as long as possible.

The truth is, buyers want to be in control of everything, not just the research part of making a purchasing decision. And more than anything else, they want to be in control of how and when they are contacted. Prospects aren’t interested in hearing from you directly until they know you can help them and they are ready to receive your help. This can prove to be a challenge, especially when we want to control the marketing and sales process every step of the way. Think of yourself when you are considering buying something. Do you want to be bombarded by phone calls, emails, and text messages while you are doing your initial research? Do you want to enter your email and/or phone number in an opt-in form just to get information that you need as part of your research? No, you don’t. This brings us to Revenue Zone rule #2.

As I mentioned in Chapter 1, your B2B prospects want to buy the same way they do as consumers. They want to do their own research, come to their own decisions, and then purchase. They want to control the journey and talk with someone only when they are ready and only when that conversation is going to be consultative and valuable. Essentially, they want to be their own salesperson.

Offer your B2B prospects the information they need in a way that is easy to access and understand. Consider creating a resource center on your website that contains the most useful and relevant information your prospects are likely to look for at different stages in their journey. The bottom line is that you want to make it easy for your prospect to buy without ever feeling like they are being sold.
